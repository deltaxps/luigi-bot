this was an idea inspired by the discord bot "Mario!", a chatbot-like bot that replies to users when they mention the word Mario\
(or "what" it seems)\

this was done for fun since theres no Luigi counterpart to the Mario bot(besides this?) and i may or may not update this

the original source was from [here](https://github.com/cmontminy/luigi-bot), "luigi bot" made by [Colette Montminy "cmontminy"](https://github.com/cmontminy), who unfortunately has not been seen in a while.\
i have heavily modified this to fit in a style more like the Mario chatbot, the original "luigi bot" source has not had an update for over 3 years now.
this bot(as of now) does **not** use commands or "prefixes", just replies to anything with the word "luigi" in it

[Colette Montminy "cmontminy"](https://github.com/cmontminy) for the original source *(and getting me to speedrun learning discord.py)*\
[Mario Wiki](https://www.mariowiki.com/List_of_Luigi_quotes) for some quotes the bot uses

do anything with this i guess\
