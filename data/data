Oh yeah! Who's #1 now? Luigi!
Hey, that's-a pretty good-a. Oh yeah!
Oh, well. Next time.
All right!
Yay for me, Luigi!
Here we go!
Too fast!
I'm-a Luigi, number one!
Luigi is the top!
Bingo! Oh ho ho ho!
Here we go!
Yahoo!
I hope she made lotsa spaghetti!
And YOU gotta help us!
Looks are deceiving, when Koopas are involved!
How are we gonna find the princess with the power going out?
You bring a light?
Well, maybe a Koopa will lend us his! If we 'persuade' him.
She's not coming down!
Over there!
Look! Wendy's hotel!
That's that creepy Bowser's laugh!
...There's fire!
You're the best player ever!
Wow, nice!
Luigi time!
Oh yeah, Luigi!
Luigi win! Luigi #1! Wow.
Luigi on the red team!
Blue team yeah!
Oh, Luigi lose! MAMMA!
Ohh, Mamma Mia. Luigi lose!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, MAMA!
Ohh, Mamma Mia. No good... Ohh.
Wow. Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Thank You!
Cool!
Oh, thank you!
Mario Kart! Could've been Luigi!
Luigi Kart Wii!
Let's-a go!
Ohhhhh, lose again!
Oh yeah! Nice! Okey-dokey!
Oh! Not Luigi time!
Luigi sad, so sad.
Oh! Why Luigi do that?
Luigi Kart 8!

All right!
First place Luigi!
Luigi, #1!
Oh, yeah, can't stop Luigi!
Oh! I did it!
Oh yeah! Luigi did it!
Good job, Luigi!
Oh yeah, pretty good!
Oh, what happened?
Luigi not happy.
(Cries), mama!
Look out!

Wheee!
L time!
Up time!
Magic!
Got it!
Ooo, hot...
Thanks, buddy!
See you!
Bye bye!
Bingo!
Super Luigi!
Zoom zoom!
All right!
Owie!
Yippee!
Here we go!
Yahoo!
Yippee!
Yahoo!
Let's-a go.
Let's-a go.
Pow, pow.
Bang bang!
Okey dokey!! Look out... FORE!
That's-a wonderful.
Here we go.
Here I am.
Hurry up already, eh?
Yeah! All right!
It's so shiny.
Luigi, Luigi, oh yeah, oh yeah.
GOOOOOOLLLF!
Oh, dear. I've-a practiced, but nobody play with Luigi! Will you play with me?
Oh! Tough shot!
This is a very tense moment!
You look ridiculous!
Wow! Make it or break it!
Oh, yeah! Looking good!
Wowser, you're the best!
You're unbelievable!
You gotta believe!
(Cries), I'm a loser!
Hey, Mario! We got a letter from Princess Peach!
I'll read it to you, OK?
All right, let's see...
Well, Mario, I guess you better get going.
What a magnificent castle! I never get used to this place. It looks like lots of guests are already here.
I wonder what my brother Mario is doing right now...
Mario! It's you! It's great to see you!
Oh? And who are you?
I see. Great, just great. You're on an exciting adventure with Mario. Talk about unfair. See, someone has to look after this house, so I can't leave. Oh well. Take care of Mario, OK?
I was one hot sacrifice, Bro.
Wanna hear what happened? It's a pretty long story...
Hey, sounds good to me! Which part of my story you wanna hear, Bro?
You go, Bro!
Everyone runs out of extra lives sometime.
T-Toad?! What? What happened? Why are you so crazy?
I don't give my name to scoundrels! Just watch as Luigi punishes you for your badness!
This looks like a job for Luigi!
One of Count Bleck's minions must have done me in.
You dirty little traitor!
The G-Great Luigi, you say? A... A daring defender? ...Me? Then I've got no choice! Luigi must spring into action! My fans need me!
BRO! I'm so glad you found me!
Ooh, how did I end up in this stinky place?
That's my bro, always bouncing back! Like me! I bounce too!
I'm my bro's bro.
Quiet, you big Bowser! We know you kidnapped Princess Peach! Now where'd you put her?!
Hey, you! You're the boss of all those crazy guys who escaped The Underwhere, aren't you?!
Hey! Stop messing around and fight us for real!
SHAG?! This mustache is pure Luigi!
Pushover?! I'll show you who's a pushover!
Thanks, bro!
Oh, me? Just one of Count Bleck's more promising minions. The Green Thunder... MR. L!
Just because you're in red doesn't mean you're strong. Have at you!
Ooh, the evil king of all charlatans! Do I look scared? Have at you!
No one's coming to save you this time, dearest princess! Have at you!
Hey, Mr. Jumpsallthetime! NOW we'll see who's the better jumper!
Hey, Mr. Getsfoiledallthetimebytheredguywiththemustache! I'll foil your FACE!
Hey, Ms. Pink n' Frilly! Try not to get kidnapped before I defeat you! Have at you!
Hey, Ms. Alwayskidnapped! I'll kidnap your FACE!
I uh... got to go deflavorize the Brobot's uh... Flavorizer.
Hey there, butterball!
Hey, King Incompetent! I'm gonna hatch an evil plan on your FACE! Have at you!
Looks like your Pure Heart thing got broken. I guess Pure Hearts can't handle the end of the world. Heh. Whatever, I'll swipe it just for kicks.
Not a funny joke, Dimentio... If I wanted to laugh, your face is inspiration enough!
But Brobot craves his daily smash! I can't just loiter here! There's no action!
I AM MR.L!
Meet my new friend... BROBOT L-TYPE!
I was just scouting him, dear. Next time, he will be mine!
Mario! It's-a me!
I don't know how it happened, but some green paint fell out of the sky and repainted my kart!
Let's-a race down Rainbow Road and save Peach!
Okeydokey! You-a ready?
Yes! Here we gooooo!
Well, it sounds like you've been on quite an adventure without me, Bro!
But at least I can help you out a little a-bit with the driving, Princess-a Peach-a here we come!
We're getting a-close... to something.
MAMMA MIA! It leads to a giant creepy rock in the sky!
But we can't stop a-now! You guys have worked way too hard for me to chicken out here!
Hold on! I'm-a gonna floor it! Hopefully we won't fall off the road. Lakitu's not a-here to save us!
Phew! We made it.
You guys be-a careful in there, OK? I'll... I'll just wait here. You know. In case you need a ride back.
Mario! Peach! Huey!
I wasn't sure you guys were gonna make it!
Get on the kart! We're a-getting out of here!
Peach, you're first. Hurry!
I think he's-a right, Bro. Trust me-I've fallen off Rainbow Road more times than I can count.
It's a-now or never!
Ah! Oh my God!
Yahaa! I'm the best!
Yeah! Luigi's the winner!
No matter how you look at it, I'm the nicest in the world!
Since I'm so kind, the Kindness Star Stamp belongs to me - Luigi!
Battle me, the king of kindness!
I am the strongest one in the universe! Me!
That's why the Strength Star Stamp should go to me!
I'll show you my strength!
I - Luigi - am more courageous than the rest! Just ask anyone!
That's why the Courage Star Stamp should go to me!
Show your courage - play with me!
Oh no! I lost! Oh!
Yes!
Good choice!
Aw, I lost!
Good choice!
Aw, I lost!
Ha ha ha, I'm the best!
Oh yeah, Luigi like-a dat!
Oh yeah, I'm a winner!
Achoo! Oh, sorry!
Mario Party 8! Whee!
Yeah, Luigi wins!
Come on, Let's-a go.
Oh, boooo!
Yes! Luigi won!
I'm ready!
Yeah! We're the Superstars!
Wow-ee, wow-ee!
Luigi time!
Luigi number one!
What a dreadful picture... But that candle next to it might be important...
I'm willing to bet there's something cold in here.
Hello?
I always preferred the bottom bunk...
Well, at least we won't have a shortage of toilet paper...
Now that's just not my style.
Mario?
You know... I never noticed how cute those red polka dots look on top!
It's a picture...but I wouldn't call it art.
I wonder if there are any goodies there.
Exquisite...
Fabulous!
What in the world is this?
I do it.
Mama-mia...
Ohohohoh, Mario!
Ohhh boy...
H-h-h-hello?
I do it!
Here I go... *gulp*
No, no, no. Bad doggie!
Heeeey.
Marioooo, yoohoo!
I got it!
I did it!
Wowie!
Y-yes, I did.
Here you go.
Th-thanks, Mario.
Come here, Doggie...
M-hm.
Ahhh, I did it.
Yello?
Good job!
Thank you very much!
Uh, ah.. ACHOOHWEEY!!
Help help!
Over here!
Uh-oh.
Here you go.
Waugh! *cough*
Yoo-hoo...
Let's-a go!
Come on!
I do it!
Let's do it!
Oh, yeah!
Wowie zowie!
Uh, bye.
OK.
Night, night.
Hello?
Oh no!
Mario?
M-Mario?
Eek! No one told me there would be gh-gh-ghosts here! I wish I'd brought my Poltergust 3000 with me.
Hey! You know what would look good? A spaceship with MY face on it!
These ruins are right up my alley! I bet I'll reach the goal first!
Watch out everyone! Luigi is stepping up to the plate!
Leaping lasagna! This place is even bigger than Peach's Castle!
Vroom, Vroom! Let's get this game started. Someone wave the checkered flag!
This place is wackadoodle! It's turning my brain into spaghetti!
Ah, Peach's Castle! I have some awfully fond memories of this place. Time to create a new one!
Now, THIS is where the real action is! It's happening on Yoshi's Island!
I'm gonna try to make a speed run through this stage!
I don't trust Bowser OR his spooky castle... I bet he's got a princess or two locked up in here!
Actually, I had planned on spending the afternoon flossing my teeth.
That's a mirage, your royal nincompoopship!
A pipeline job by tonight? I can't start a job this big on an empty stomach.
Help, Mario! I'm swimming in a sea of pipes!
I think hunger is making me hallucinate!
Nooo! I've been having pipe dreams about that canneloni!
Help! I'm being devoured by vile vegetation!
D'habitude, je suis discret! Mais cette fois... c'est moi le héros!!!
Mais pourquoi tout le monde me méprise, hein? Je suis pourtant plus intelligent que Mario! Et puis il suffit de lire l'histoire Level 8 pour comprendre que j'ai aussi plus de chance que lui!
I can't! I'm allergic to mountains!
P-polar bear? Lunch!?
Hey, Super Mario! Super-cook their goose!
(*sobs*) He was the nicest little fungus I ever knew!
Who could forget? Don't take chances or you'll go down the drain!
C-c-crama's here in-in Koopalot? Uh, I mean, uh, Koopa's here in Cramalot? I mean, uh, shee, let's split this place!
Me? B-b-but I can't swim across the moat! I'm, uh, gonna have a baby!
Fellons? Yo, I never fell on nobody! I'm uh...
Oh no! End dend! I mean, dend dead! I mean shee, we're trapped!
Mama mia! We shoulda rented a camel with air conditioning!
Look at that loot! Diamonds, gold, rubies! It must be worth over a hundred bucks!
Okay, Mario. One all ya got, coming up!
He's too busy eating, Mario! He's your kind of horse.
Hey! That's my brother Mario, you three-faced double-crosser!
Leapin' lasagna! This room's bigger than the Brooklyn Public Library!
Yo, let's get cookin'!
I th-think I liked it better when we outnumbered them!
I'd feel better if we went back and got my stomach.
That's what I call Shower Power!
Yo, my brother: the pasta vampire.
Gee, that Mario. He can pulverize a pasta factory and still have room for dessert!
Gee. Mario gets the brainstorms, and I get the backaches!
Let's really keep it a secret that we're agents, uhh, by stayin' here!
Eh, it was nothin'! Danger is our business!
Annette Funicello? Where?
Pluggin' up pipes goes against everythin' we stand for!
Zelda of Legend! Next the from scenes! Some me show halfwit you!
The dungeon? I'm allergic to dungeons!
Better make that The more for Mario!
We're stuck here like hairballs in a drainpipe!
Hey! I may be crazy, but I'm not dumb!
This place is emptier than a flushed drainpipe!
I want my mommy!
Diet? I heard that! I'm not the one who needs to diet!
The Koopas are coming! The Koopas are coming!
Let me have it, ya little snowball!
Aww, Toad. Did'ya hafta say dead?
How ooga bugga-mugga wa-ooga-ma!
Ouch! Someone's standin' on my toe, and it's not me!
Mario's mind was where it always is: on pasta.
Relax, princess! He knows who he is! Mario's always gone ape for meatballs!
I'm a chicken of the sea!
The only good thing so far is: we got to ride the roller coaster without a ticket!
Stop him, Mario! Tell him Italian food is not on his diet!
I knew we should've built this raft with brakes!
Bein' garbage really makes a guy feel down in the dumps!
Koopa was scary enough when he was just a slimy reptile!
You got 'em!
You don't got 'em.
Nice crash landing, Mario!
Uh, excuse me! But I gotta find that map salesman, and buy a map to someplace else!
Ride 'em, plumber boy!
Well, I had to kiss Kootie Pie!
Tanks for reminding me.
We unclogged the past!
Yeah, maybe next time old Koopa will pick on someone his own size!
Hey, but I am a baby!
Hey, Mario! WAAAAAAAAA!!!
There, now it's even hotter!
Mario, think of all the fun we had as kids! All the drains we've unclogged! Remember the time you lost your favorite screwdriver and I gave you one of mine?
Come out! I dare ya, ya Venus Fire Trap!
Whoa! Looks like it's a hot time in the old volcano tonight!
They don't call us super for nothing!
I hate to dance!
I don't see why we have to wear these dumb penguin suits!
Hey, what's a cement suit to a guy who swims better than most fish?
Whoa, what a dog pile! Hang on, guys! In a minute we'll blow this doghouse!
If that isn't Hip and Hop, my name is Fido!
Well, there goes the neighborhood!
Ahh! It's a garbage storm!
Well what are we supposed to do? Wave a magic wand and make it all go away?
Hey, let's get out of sight behind this knight!
WHOA! I'd say he's hot on our tail!
Uh-oh. Mario, what's big and green and follows you everywhere you go?
This gondola's gonna make us goners!
I'm digging as fast as I can! Oops, I just bent the spoon.
Well, if it isn't my birthday, it's nice to have a cake.
Poor dinosaur; he doesn't know the indigestion he's in for!
It's a football! I chiseled it!
Well like they say in Brooklyn, early to bed, early to catch the worm. Or is it the bagel?
Koopa Football Players grabbed the princess! Mario was attacked by a Koopa Wizard and a Magnum Bill! And I found myself, face-to-face, with a Fire Sumo!
I fell for hours!
Mario, wherever you are...HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELP!!!
That's Mama Luigi to you, Mario!
It's all right! He wants to shake hands! He wants to be friends!!
